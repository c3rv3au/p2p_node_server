# p2p_node_server

Created by Eric Grenier alias C3rv3au (brain in english)

This is a P2P server solution written in Node.Js. No need of database server, or memcache server. Peer are connected together and auto scale any services to another peer when need within it's own cluster.

All is about ressource. This server should be able to buy ressources from other user of this server. Cloud can be made with this software only and everything should be automated.

We use DataCenter ID to identify where is the peer located. This way, we can easily restart a service when a peer is down or improve any service when it's getting slower.

Users can host them self, but domains, web hosting and other services can be purchase directly from the 127.0.0.1 GUI dashboard.

Server should auto-update it-self to the last version on this GIT. But we should do our own GIT server later.

Not mature yet and can't be used in production.
